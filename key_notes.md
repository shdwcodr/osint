Key notes & ethics:

This script only checks public web pages — it does not try to bypass protections, login, or access private data.

I won’t help enumerate or brute-force phone numbers, national IDs, or similar personal data. That’s dangerous and often illegal.

If you plan to use HaveIBeenPwned, register and put your API key in HIBP_API_KEY — be mindful of their terms and rate limits.

If you’re doing research for a client or employer, get written permission first.
